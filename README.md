## Notes
- File 'start' used as startpage with next tasks and links to other interested files.
- File 'inbox' used for quick notes and tasks which will later be moved to other files, usually it is empty.
- Sections 'NOW' and 'NEXT' dont show tasks without any date.
- Tasks with due date appear on 'NOW' section a week before the date. Tasks with other dates at it day. Same rules for shopping lists.
- Tasks with due date appear on 'NEXT' section one month before the date. Tasks with other dates - two weeks before the date.
